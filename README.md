# Password Generator

This Repository contains a Project where I developed a password generator to create random passwords. This password generator has options to toggle characters and change the length of the password.

This Password Generator was built using Svelte and Vite.

## How to use

The password generator is hosted at [password.moritzschuessler.de](password.moritzschuessler.de).

The project can be build using `npm run build`.
